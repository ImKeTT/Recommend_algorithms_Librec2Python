# Python implementations of Recommender System algorithms from [Librec](https://github.com/guoguibing/librec)

## Algorithms

### Some of them are not my own implementations. And the paper related to the algorithms will be attached.

1. **AutoRec** (AutoRec: Autoencoders Meet Collaborative Filtering)  *implemented by Pytorch*
2. [CDAE](https://github.com/henry0312/CDAE) (Collaborative Denoising Auto-Encoders for Top-K Recommender Systems)*implemented by keras*
3. **FM** (Factorization Machine)
4. **Item/User-based K-NN**
5. **PMF** (Probabilistic Matrix Factorization)
6. [NCF](https://github.com/yihong-chen/neural-collaborative-filtering)(Neural Collaborative Filtering) *implement by Pytorch*

## Dataset

- ml-1M from [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/)
- ml-100k from MovieLens

Both of them are in the *DATASET*  file

More to be continued....
